Example usage (assuming google colab, but i think you should be able to put it all together in any linux environment):

!pip install inference

from google.colab import userdata
from inference import get_model
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = userdata.get('ROBOFLOW_API_KEY')
MODEL_ID = "minecraft-tree-detection-qrp0d-lhimu/1" # model id of the correct model
model = get_model(MODEL_ID, ROBOFLOW_API_KEY)

import cv2
IMAGE_PATH = "/content/test_image.jpg"
image = cv2.imread(IMAGE_PATH)

results = model.infer(image, confidence=0.4)

import supervision as sv
detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(results[0])
annotated_image = image.copy()
annotated_image = sv.BoxAnnotator().annotate(scene=annotated_image, detections=detections)
annotated_image = sv.LabelAnnotator().annotate(scene=annotated_image, detections=detections)
sv.plot_image(annotated_image)
