Our VPT Attempt is based on this(https://github.com/openai/Video-Pre-Training) GitHub repository by OpenAI VPT.

Within this file, the log file represents the log that was created when performing behavioral cloning on the foundation weight 1x.

finetuned-1x.weights is our initial behavioral cloning weight, while finetuned-1xTree.weights is our
behavioral training attempt on hand picked video data.

We were unable to upload our own finetuned model weights file due to the size limitation(around 500 mb). Please send an email to hyungjoonk@vt.edu if you wish to see our model, and we would try sharing it using google drive.
